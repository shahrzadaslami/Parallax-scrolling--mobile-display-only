        <h2>METALLICA</h2>
       <p class="subtext">the history</p>
       <p>influential American heavy metal band that, along with
            Slayer and Anthrax, developed the subgenre speed metal
             in the early and mid-1980s. The principal members were
              lead singer and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield 
              (b. August 3, 1963, Downey, California, U.S.), 
              drummer Lars Ulrich (b. December 26, 1963, Gentofte, Denmark), 
              lead guitarist Kirk Hammett (b. November 18, 1962, San Francisco, 
              California), and bassist Cliff Burton 
              (b. February 10, 1962, San Francisco—d. September 27, 1986,
               near Stockholm, Sweden). Jason Newsted 
               (b. March 4, 1963, Battle Creek, Michigan) 
               took over on bass after Burton was 
           killed in a tour bus accident. </p>

            <h2>METALLICA</h2>
           <p class="subtext">the history</p>
           <p>In January 2001 Newsted left the group, leaving 
               Metallica without a bassist once again. Work on 
               a new album was delayed while the band sought a
                replacement for Newsted, and Hetfield entered treatment 
                for alcoholism. Bob Rock, who had produced the band since 1991,
                 filled in on bass as Metallica entered the studio to record
                  St. Anger (2003). True to its title, the album was a rage-fueled
                   exploration of Hetfield’s psyche that confirmed to listeners 
                   that sobriety had not dulled the singer’s edge. Metallica added
                    Robert Trujillo, former bassist for Ozzy Osbourne and skate-punk 
                    band Suicidal Tendencies, to the band’s lineup prior to
                embarking on the St. Anger tour. </p>
